                <p>Just as summer’s most popular styling motifs have started to feel stale (sorry, rosettes!), 2023’s fall fashion trends are here to help us hit the reset button. The vibe this season has been hailed as so-called quiet luxury, i.e., high-quality capsule wardrobe essentials that don’t draw attention to themselves. But while that’s not exactly wrong (we saw many trench coats layered over jeans), it’s not the whole story.</p>

            <p>Blue jeans, white tank, flannel shirt. In the end, it was one of the subtler looks from the Bottega Veneta spring/summer 2023 show that got the front row snapping and subsequently set Instagram alight. Sure, it was worn by Kate Moss, for whom a runway appearance is a happening these days. And sure, it turned out to be a not-so-simple combination of wafer-thin leather tank, leather trousers dyed to resemble faded jeans and a flannel shirt that required 12 layers of print to achieve that just-so colour. </p>
